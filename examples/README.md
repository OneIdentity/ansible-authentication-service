# Examples

A small collection of sample files has been included to help get you started.  

## Inventory Examples

[Simple](inventory_simple.yml) and [complex](inventory_complex.yml) inventory files have been included.  There are many ways besides YAML files to pass inventory information to Ansible, see [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html) for further information.

## `client_sw` Role Example

The [`client_sw`](run_client_sw.yml) role example shows use of the `client_sw` role in an Ansbile playbook.  The variables most likely to be overriden have been included in this playbook for your convenience even though many are still set to their default values.
